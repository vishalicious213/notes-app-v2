# Notes App with Markdown Editor v2

New repo with Notes App (with Firebase support). The old version didn't deploy properly to Netlify because of a dependency version issue with __react-mde__, __react__, __react-dom__ and __eslint__. As of the time of this build, __react-mde__ only supports React up to v17. The prior repo was built using v18.
